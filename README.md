# mover
 Fast and precise preset locations for windows. I hate the default system of windows 11 window management.
 A simple template to begin automating a workflow.

Packed with UPX: https://github.com/upx/upx

 - Last window active is now auto selected even when titles are identical
 - The window list now refreshes once per second
 - Duplicate settings are now auto ignored
 - Stable with 100+ buttons
